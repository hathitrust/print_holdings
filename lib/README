All homebrew Ruby and Python modules should reside here.

Make sure that the path to this dir is included in your ENV's RUBYLIB and PYTHONPATH.

For example, in your shell profile:

    RUBYLIB='/path/to/this/dir/:/path/to/some/other/dir/';
    export RUBYLIB;

    PYTHONPATH='/path/to/this/dir/:/path/to/some/other/dir/';
    export PYTHONPATH;
