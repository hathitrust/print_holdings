Everything here is done by starting step_01.sh.
It calls h_distribution_report-all.py and plot_H_histogram_stacked.py and puts the output into a .tgz file.

h_distribution_report-all.py is still, at this writing, missing a python lib.

plot_H_histogram_stacked.py has a hardcoded value for max_H which needs to be fixed.

So, do:

  >$ step_01.sh

... and give it a minute. Copy tar file to machine, extract and upload images google drive, to a new dir under plots.
