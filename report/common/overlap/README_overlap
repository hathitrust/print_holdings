A common (?) question is what the overlap is between a given members'
print holdings and that of the rest of Hathi.

For instance (edited, in vain, for brevity):

  The University of Delaware Library (UD) is beginning to investigate the possibility of withdrawing part of its out of
  copyright print material based on the holdings in the HathiTrust repository.
  
  I was unable to find information about this on the HathiTrust web site. Since the Library has sent its holdings
  to you, would it be possible to provide the number of out of copyright titles that UD owns that are in the repository?
  Can the specific titles be provided to UD? Was data sent that would also enable identifying the number of volumes?

This is all done by hathi_overlap.rb. All it needs is a member_id as input.
This is roughly what it does, in 2 steps:

Step 1, get all the oclc-copy_count pairs for UD:

SELECT DISTINCT h2.oclcs, h3.copy_count FROM holdings_htitem AS h2, holdings_htitem_htmember_jn AS h3 WHERE h2.volume_id = h3.volume_id AND h3.member_id = 'udel' AND h2.rights IN ('pd', 'pdus');

Step 2, go over these rows. Since h2.oclcs can be a multi-value list we need to split it up. Then query hathi_files on oclc.

    SELECT DISTINCT oclc
    FROM hathi_files
    WHERE oclc IN (__LIST_OF_OCLC__)

Return the list of OCLCs that overlap, plus perhaps some extra bells and gongs depending on what the client asks for.
