Run the member counts report like:

$ nohup bash run_all.sh > member_counts.log &

It takes several hours, and produces several files under data/.
Append some of those files thusly (with $ymd replaced appropriately):

[print_holdings]$ perl report/append_sheets.pl --na=0 data/total_member_counts_2_$ymd.tsv data/matching_oclc_counts_2_$ymd.tsv data/matching_item_counts_2_$ymd.tsv | column -t > data/member_counts_appended_$ymd.tsv

This gives you a .tsv that you can incorporate into the "current month" tab of the Member Counts report.
