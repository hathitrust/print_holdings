Steps:

(all paths relative to this dir)

1. Get the rawest data from the database.

   >$ sh step_01.sh

   It will write to step_01_out.tsv, and took me 30min last time I ran it.

2. Condense the data a little bit further with some AWK.

   >$ sh step_02.sh

   It will write to step_02_out.tsv. Takes a couple of minutes.

3. Get a frequency list of cc-ac pairs.

   >$ sh step_03.sh

   It will write to step_03_out.tsv. A minute or so.

4. Sum ac and cc grouped by #items

   >$ sh step_04.sh

    It will write to step_04_out.tsv, instantaneous.

5. Get averages among non-CIC members:

   >$ ruby non_cic_average.rb

   This reads cic_condensed.tsv and will tell you numbers like:
   "for the 189354 books held by 10 CIC members, 
   there are an average 3995012 copies among non-CIC members with an average 0.004 open and 1.142 closed".

   Took about 90 min to run 4821 queries with a IN()-size of max 1000 volume_ids.

6. Generate pretty-printed text report.

   >$ ruby prettyprint_report.rb

   It will write to cic_counts_report.tsv.
