Hi Martin,

I am wondering if you could produce a report for the University of Alabama with the following four columns:

The first having a list of OCLC numbers for works that Alabama holds that are also in HathiTrust.
The second having an indication of whether the work in HathiTrust is a spm, mpm, or serial.
The third having an indication of whether items in HathiTrust associated with that OCLC number are pd, ic, or both (include open access works in pd).
The fourth having an indication of whether Alabama listed the work as being lost or missing, or brittle, in the holdings data they provided.

1  pd  copyright   public domain
7  ic-world	   access    in-copyright and permitted as world viewable by the copyright holder
9  pdus            copyright public domain only when viewed in the US

select hf.oclc, hf.rights from hathi_files hf join holdings_memberitem hm on (hf.oclc = hm.oclc) where hm.member_id = 'udel';

Took only 48 minutes.
