Steps:

(all paths relative to this dir)

1. Get the rawest data from the database.

   >$ sh step_01.sh

   It will write to step_01_out.tsv, and took me 30min last time I ran it.

2. Condense the data a little bit further with some AWK.

   >$ sh step_02.sh

   It will write to step_02_out.tsv. Takes a couple of minutes.

   In theory, one could start step 5 at this point already, but the
   intervening steps are so short and sweet that it may be pointless.

3. Get a frequency list of cc-ac pairs.

   >$ sh step_03.sh

   It will write to step_03_out.tsv. A minute or so.

4. Sum ac and cc grouped by #items

   >$ sh step_04.sh

    It will write to step_04_out.tsv, instantaneous.

5. Get averages among all Hathi members:

   >$ ruby hathi_cic_average.rb

   This reads step_02_out.tsv and will tell you numbers like:
   "for the 189354 open books held by 10 CIC members, 
   there are 230000 among all of hathi, with an average 45.1 
   members holding each item.

   Took about 90 min to run 4821 queries with a IN()-size 
   of max 1000 volume_ids.

   Writes to hathi_cic_counts.tsv

6. Generate pretty-printed text report.

   >$ ruby prettyprint_report.rb

   It will write to cic_report_pretty.tsv.
