The Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC) wants to maybe join as a consortium. They already have one member in HT, Georgetown.

So, perhaps the easiest way is to decrease H with 1 for all records in holdings_htitem_H where a volume_id is held by Georgetown, then just do a regular estimate.

Gotta wait for the build to finish first.
