This directory contains data submitted from members.
A prospective member gets a subdir called member_id.estimate/.
An actual member gets a subdir called member_id/.

Each subdir contains the submitted files, a logfile, an old/ subdir and a copy of scrub.rb.
The local scrub.rb is adjusted to fit the submitted files. Each time you scrub something,
mention it in the logfile.

When a directory is not being actively worked on, close it (gz + tar) with
  bash close_tgz.sh member_id

When you need to do some work on a closed directory, open it (unzip + untar) with:
  bash open_tgz.sh member_id
