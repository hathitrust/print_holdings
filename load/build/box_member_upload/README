These scripts use curl to crawl & upload files to folders in box

Your .netrc should have: 

machine ftp.box.com
login hathitrust-cloud-validator@umich.edu
password ASK_SOMEBODY_FOR_THIS

If you move member folders around, run: 

ruby box_member_urls.rb > member_urls.txt

Otherwise, you can use this cached information to run:

upload_to_folder.sh inst_id filename

e.g.

upload_to_folder.sh umich test.txt
