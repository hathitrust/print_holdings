When a prospective member wants to know approximately what their membership fee will be,
they send us their holdings. Download into data/memberdata/${member_id}.estimate/ and scrub.

Look up the avg_cost_per_vol from the most recent cost report:

$ grep '^@avg_cost_per_vol' costreport_${YYYYMMDD}_details.tsv

Finally, you need to know username and password for a user with (pretty much) full mysql
privileges for ht_repository.

Run:

$ ruby step_01.rb <avg_cost_per_vol> <member_id>

... and give mysql login info when prompted.

The script will output a .tsv to STDERR and write a "narrative" file to
data/estimate/narrative_ida_${YYYYMMDD}.txt

Upload the .tsv to Google Drive, PHDB>Estimates, add PD cost from last cost report...

$ grep '^pd_cost_per_m' costreport_20170912_details.tsv

... add graph to sheet, and change access to "anyone with the link".

Add link and narrative text to Jira ticket and close data/memberdata/${member_id}.estimate/.
